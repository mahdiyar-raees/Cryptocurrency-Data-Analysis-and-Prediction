# Project Overview
Welcome to the Cryptocurrency Data Analysis and Prediction Project, a comprehensive exploration of cryptocurrency data, clustering, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling. This project encompasses various aspects of cryptocurrency analysis, combining data retrieval, data processing, and machine learning.

#### Section 1: Clustering
In this section, we focus on clustering analysis using historical data from the top 4 cryptocurrencies over a one-year period. We apply K-Means and hierarchical clustering techniques to discover patterns in the data, with a primary focus on 'market cap' and 'volume.' The results are visualized through scatter plots.

#### Section 2: Web Scraping and Database Creation
The project involves web scraping to collect one year's worth of cryptocurrency data. This data is then used to create an SQL database, enabling easy access and efficient data management. We perform statistical calculations on the dataset to gain insights into cryptocurrency trends.

#### Section 3: Predictive Modeling
This section is dedicated to predictive modeling, where we leverage machine learning algorithms to forecast the future prices of specific cryptocurrencies. We explore different models and evaluate their performance to make informed predictions.
