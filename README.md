# Cryptocurrency Data Analysis and Prediction
Project Overview
Welcome to the Cryptocurrency Data Analysis and Prediction Project, an exhaustive exploration of cryptocurrency data, including data clustering, statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and dynamic visualizations using Power BI. This multifaceted project incorporates diverse facets of cryptocurrency analysis, combining data retrieval, processing, and machine learning.

## Section 1: Clustering
In this initial section, we delve into comprehensive clustering analysis, employing historical data from the top four cryptocurrencies spanning a one-year timeframe. We meticulously apply K-Means and hierarchical clustering techniques, with particular emphasis on 'market cap' and 'volume.' The outcomes are presented through visually insightful scatter plots.

## Section 2: Web Scraping and Database Creation
The project features a meticulous data acquisition process involving web scraping to amass one year's worth of cryptocurrency data. Subsequently, this data is meticulously utilized to construct an SQL database, facilitating seamless data access and effective management. A suite of statistical analyses provides valuable insights into prevailing cryptocurrency trends.

## Section 3: Predictive Modeling
The third section is dedicated to the development of predictive models, capitalizing on advanced machine learning algorithms to predict the future prices of select cryptocurrencies. A systematic exploration of diverse models is undertaken, culminating in a thorough evaluation of their performance for the purpose of making judicious predictions.

## Power BI Dashboard
As a highlight of this project, we also present a dynamic Power BI dashboard that offers an interactive and visual representation of cryptocurrency data. This dashboard adds a layer of real-time data visualization, further enhancing the insights derived from our analyses.
